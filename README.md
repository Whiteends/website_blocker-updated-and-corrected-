# website_blocker-updated-and-corrected-
You can preemptively block websites with this script but that will mean you have an admin access and also, this is for a windows system
A couple of months ago, i saw some friends distributing some "methods of blocking nude/pornographic websites" and i don't feel comfortable with the method as it involves setting an unknown entity as an IOpS so i wrote a python script to block any website you want but you must have an admin priviledge before executing this script.
